    "# Introduction\n",
    "In laboratories we interact with a lot of instruments on which to collect data. We will write a programme to read in real data from an instrument and plot it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mini project we will load and manipulate a file of UV data. Once loaded we will also perform simple data manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that loading data files can be made simpler if using some scientific libraries. However, these libraries assume certain conventional formats for presenting data. A lot of scientific data is generated in unexpected formats as is the case in this exercise. Your objective should be to try to understand the format of the data and design a parser accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: A **parser** is a piece of code that takes data supplied by the user and splits it up into appropriate variables and data types. It parses the data in a similar way to how we parse language\n",

The documentation for this library is very comprehensive, so for instance if you wanted to make a scatter plot instead of a line plot, it may help to read up on `ax.scatter()` ([link](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html))."

    "It is time to put all of these new skills to use.\n",

    "Open a new file in your favourite code editor (VSCode, Spyder, Sublime etc.). Write a Python script that reads in the iodine spectrum data from `proj_1.csv` and plots it.\n",

    "General advice:\n",
    "- You will need to make empty lists before your `for` loop, so that you can append the relevant numbers to these lists.\n",
    "- A lot of lines from the `.csv` file don't have any spectral data. You will have to make sure that your code ignores those lines when it imports the data.\n",
    "- The header lines do contain information on the experiment that might be useful, think of how you could store these.\n",

    "Key points:\n",
